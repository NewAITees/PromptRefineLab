## Principles

- Prefer small, auditable changes.
- Keep the Skill logic pure; no UI or persistence side effects.
- Document decisions before implementing them.

## Repo conventions

- Documentation lives in `docs/`.
- CLI and Skill modules should be separated once they exist.
- Keep data models stable and versioned.

## Decision records

When the stack is chosen, add lightweight decision records under `docs/decisions/`.
